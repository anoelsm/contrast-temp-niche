# Comparing <i>Prochlorococcus</i> temperature niches in the lab and across ocean basins
For full publication see: [(https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11777)]

## Description

The purpose of this project was to quantify and compare the fundamental (i.e. lab-derived) and realized (i.e. field-derived) temperature niches for four ecotypes of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> (eMED4, eMIT9312, eMIT9313 eNATL2A) across four ocean basins. Here we provide the full commented R code used to analyze the data, provide the statistical comparisons, and plot the figures seen in the publication.
